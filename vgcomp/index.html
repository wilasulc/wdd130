                <h3>Why will people come to your site?</h3>
                <p>
                    Commercial video games have progressed a long way since their beginning in the early 1970s.
                    Videogames have evolved from processing power and color display measured in bits to full 3D models
                    and effects that almost look real. There are so many different videogames that you can play nowadays
                    that some people don't know where to begin.
                    My goal is to help introduce people to the hobby of videogames. I have loved videogames for a long
                    time, and I hope to share my love of videogames with the people that visit my site. I hope to
                    provide people with a desire to try out videogames as a hobby and inform them about the 3 major
                    videogame consoles of the current console generation.
                    While I could give insights into many of the different major home consoles that have been sold in
                    the past 30 years or so, I wanted to focus my attention on the most recent home consoles. These
                    consoles are not only the most accessible in retail stores today, but they will also be the most
                    prevalent for the next 4 to 8 years or so.

                <h3>What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</h3>
                <p>
                    I hope to answer questions about the newest videogame consoles on the market today. I want to inform
                    them about all the major features that are on each console, the unique benefits they provide, and
                    some background on the more popular games each console has.
                    I would also like to inform the readers of any potential shortcoming or flaw in each console because
                    each one has their fair share of flaws. I want to be as objective as I possibly can towards readers
                    and help them make an informed decision as to which consoles and games to buy.

                <h3>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information?</h3>
                <p>
                    Many different websites provide their readers with their own views on certain consoles and games.
                    There is an abundance of websites with reviews from many different people with widely varying
                    opinions and biases. Many reviews of videogame products nowadays are from people who aren't familiar
                    with videogames or have their own bias towards games, consoles, companies, publishers, and
                    developers. You can't even get a centralized opinion from large video game reviewer sites because
                    they have opinions from multiple different reviewers. You may enjoy a game or console that people
                    find bad or dislike a game or console that many people love.

                <h3>So, what will make what I say any different from the hundreds of thousands of reviewers on the
                    internet today? </h3>
                <p>
                    Well, what I hope to deliver is a simple, but informative look on videogames through
                    the experiences I have in playing them. I like to think I know what I am talking about, and I hope
                    to be as helpful as I can in helping people learn about videogames.
                    I also want to help parents of children who play videogames understand them. I want to help them
                    bond with their kids through their love of videogames and give them a basic understanding of the
                    games they enjoy. I want to help develop a bond of trust between parents and their kids and help
                    them become more involved in the things they like.

                <h3>What are the 3 major consoles of this generation?</h3>
                <p>
                    The 3 major companies that are in the home console market today are Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.
                    They each have their own consoles: Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox Series X, and the Nintendo
                    Switch.
                    It is my hope that I will do my best to inform you all of the features of each console and if it is
                    the right console for you!
