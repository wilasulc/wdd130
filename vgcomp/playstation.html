                <h3>Sony PlayStation 5</h3>
                <p>
                    As a major company that produces many kinds of electronic devices, Sony has become one of the
                    biggest names in the
                    tech industry. They first introduced the original PlayStation just in time for the holiday season
                    back in 1994.
                    Ever since then, they have been a strong force in the videogames industry as well, producing many
                    different home
                    and handheld consoles. After 4 different home consoles, Sony released their newest console towards
                    the end of
                    2020, known simply as the PlayStation 5.

                <h3>Features</h3>
                <p>
                    The PlayStation 5 comes in 2 different models: One with a disk drive (pictured here) and one
                    without. While the
                    one without the disk drive is $100 cheaper than the one with the disk drive, the one with the disk
                    drive allows
                    you to acquire games with the potential to resell or refund games on a disc that you may not enjoy
                    or want to
                    return. The disk drive is also compatible as a disc player for Blu-Ray discs, dvds, and other
                    supported media
                    discs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The technology behind the PlayStation 5 also has a lot of power behind it. It can keep cool running
                    more advanced
                    games while hardly making a sound. It has insanely fast loading times on many games, so you don't
                    have to worry
                    about waiting too long to enjoy whatever game you're playing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PlayStation also offers an additional membership program that has different features depending on
                    which program
                    you select. These can range from free monthly games to exclusive deals on other games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The controller as well is an interesting feature for the console. One of the features of the
                    controller is called
                    “Haptic Feedback.” Basically, it gives the shoulder buttons on the back of the controller resistance
                    when you pull
                    the triggers to give you a more immersive feel to whatever PS5 game you are playing.

                <h3>Drawbacks</h3>
                <p>
                    The PlayStation 5 itself is a rather large console. While it is designed not to overheat, it goes
                    about this
                    (partially) by taking up more space and allowing it to ventilate better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While you can get free games with the monthly subscription programs they offer, it is from a list of
                    pre-selected
                    games. While you may end up with amazing game choices from time to time, you may also be
                    disappointed by the
                    selection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the earlier model controllers for the PlayStation 5 also occaisionally suffer from
                    what is known as "stick drift." This means that the controller can register movement on the
                    thumb-sticks due to damage, dust, or crumbs getting into the controller. However, regular cleaning
                    and maintenance can help alleviate the issue.

                <h3>Games to Play </h3>
                <p>
                    Astro's Playroom: This is a free game that is included on every PS5. It is a charming platformer game that shows
                    off the major features of the PS5 while giving you a bit of history with PlayStation itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Demon's Souls: This is a remake of an older game from the PlayStation 3. It's a roleplaying game with excellent
                    visuals and difficult, but engaging combat. If you are relatively new to video games, I would recommend caution
                    when purchasing it because the game has a reputation for its difficulty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart: This is a continuation of the Ratchet and Clank series that have been around since
                    the PlayStation 2 era. It is a cartoonish style action/adventure/platforming game with lots of interesting weapons
                    and worlds to explore.
