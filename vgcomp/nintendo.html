                <h3>Nintendo</h3>
                <p>
                    Nintendo has been a huge name in the home video game industry since the 1980s. Ever since then, they
                    have released
                    multiple home consoles, handheld consoles, and other different video-game-related accessories. Their
                    most recent
                    console is known as the Nintendo Switch. Currently, the Nintendo Switch has multiple different
                    versions that
                    operate in different capacities, but they all play the same games.

                <h3>Features</h3>
                <p>
                    The biggest selling point for the Nintendo Switch is its identity as a hybrid console. It can be
                    played on any
                    modern television with an HDMI and it is able to disconnect from its dock to be played on the go.
                    The base model
                    Nintendo Switch and the Switch OLED has a portable battery life of approximately 4 to 8 hours
                    depending on the
                    game, while the Switch Lite only has about 3 to 7 hours of battery life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The controllers on the Nintendo Switch and Switch OLED are modular controllers with multiple
                    different
                    configurations depending on how you play the game. It can be put together as one controller, used
                    when attached to
                    the main screen of the console, or even split apart and used as 2 separate controllers that can be
                    shared with
                    someone else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the games offered on the Nintendo Switch family are family friendly and make great choices
                    to give to kids
                    of all ages. They have many long-lasting franchises that people have heard of over the years such as
                    Super Mario
                    and Pokémon. They remain as the company with some of the longest lasting and highest grossing game
                    titles of all
                    time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Nintendo Switch also has an online membership program that has its own benefits, such as the
                    ability to play
                    Nintendo games online with people and a catalogue of older games from the Nintendo Entertainment
                    System and Super
                    Nintendo. It is also one of the cheaper membership programs available.

                <h3>Drawbacks</h3>
                <p>
                    Overall, the Nintendo Switch doesn't have the same kind of graphical output that most game consoles
                    possess. The
                    performance of the Switch is a bit lacking, which sometimes results in games slowing down or
                    stuttering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Nintendo has an online membership program, some of the features that it uses aren't well
                    integrated, such as
                    needing friend codes to play with friends and voice chat being regulated as a separate application
                    on your
                    smartphone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest problems with Nintendo Switch controllers is a phenomenon known as “drift.” Over
                    time as the
                    analog sticks on the controller are used, it may begin to degrade to a point where it detects
                    movement when none
                    is present. You may need to replace the controllers after a year or so.
