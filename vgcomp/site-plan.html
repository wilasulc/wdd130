        Why will people come to your site?
Commercial video games have progressed a long way since their beginning in the early 1970s. Videogames have evolved from processing power and color display measured in bits to full 3D models and effects that almost look real. There are so many different videogames that you can play nowadays that some people don’t know where to begin. 
My goal is to help introduce people to the hobby of videogames. I have loved videogames for a long time, and I hope to share my love of videogames with the people that visit my site. I hope to provide people with a desire to try out videogames as a hobby and inform them about the 3 major videogame consoles of the current console generation.
While I could give insights into many of the different major home consoles that have been sold in the past 30 years or so, I wanted to focus my attention on the most recent home consoles. These consoles are not only the most accessible in retail stores today, but they will also be the most prevalent for the next 4 to 8 years or so. 
</p>
<p>
What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
I hope to answer questions about the newest videogame consoles on the market today. I want to inform them about all the major features that are on each console, the unique benefits they provide, and some background on the more popular games each console has.
I would also like to inform the readers of any potential shortcoming or flaw in each console because each one has their fair share of flaws. I want to be as objective as I possibly can towards readers and help them make an informed decision as to which consoles and games to buy.
</p>
<p>
Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
Many different websites provide their readers with their own views on certain consoles and games. There is an abundance of websites with reviews from many different people with widely varying opinions and biases. Many reviews of videogame products nowadays are from people who aren’t familiar with videogames or have their own bias towards games, consoles, companies, publishers, and developers. You can’t even get a centralized opinion from large video game reviewer sites because they have opinions from multiple different reviewers. You may enjoy a game or console that people find bad or dislike a game or console that many people love. 

So, what will make what I say any different from the hundreds of thousands of reviewers on the internet today? Well, what I hope to deliver is a simple, but informative look on videogames through the experiences I have in playing them. I like to think I know what I am talking about, and I hope to be as helpful as I can in helping people learn about videogames. 
I also want to help parents of children who play videogames understand them. I want to help them bond with their kids through their love of videogames and give them a basic understanding of the games they enjoy. I want to help develop a bond of trust between parents and their kids and help them become more involved in the things they like.

<p>
What are the 3 major consoles of this generation?
The 3 major companies that are in the home console market today are Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo. They each have their own consoles: Sony’s PlayStation 5, Microsoft’s Xbox Series X, and the Nintendo Switch.
It is my hope that I will do my best to inform you all of the features of each console and if it is the right console for you!

      <h3>Sony PlayStation 5</h3>
      <p>
        As a major company that produces many kinds of electronic devices, Sony has become one of the biggest names in the tech industry. They first introduced the original PlayStation just in time for the holiday season back in 1994. Ever since then, they have been a strong force in the videogames industry as well, producing many different home and handheld consoles. After 4 different home consoles, Sony released their newest console towards the end of 2020, known simply as the PlayStation 5.
Features
The PlayStation 5 comes in 2 different models: One with a disk drive (Pictured here) and one without. While the one without the disk drive is $100 cheaper than the one with the disk drive, the one with the disk drive allows you to acquire games with the potential to resell or refund games on a disc that you may not enjoy or want to return. The disk drive is also compatible as a disc player for Blu-Ray discs, dvds, and other supported media discs. 
The technology behind the PlayStation 5 also has a lot of power behind it. It can keep cool running more advanced games while hardly making a sound. It has insanely fast loading times on many games, so you don’t have to worry about waiting too long to enjoy whatever game you’re playing.
PlayStation also offers an additional membership program that has different features depending on which program you select. These can range from free monthly games to exclusive deals on other games.
The controller as well is an interesting feature for the console. One of the features of the controller is called “Haptic Feedback.” Basically, it gives the shoulder buttons on the back of the controller resistance when you pull the triggers to give you a more immersive feel to whatever PS5 game you are playing.
Drawbacks
The PlayStation 5 itself is a rather large console. While it is designed not to overheat, it goes about this (partially) by taking up more space and allowing it to ventilate better.
While you can get free games with the monthly subscription programs they offer, it is from a list of pre-selected games. While you may end up with amazing game choices from time to time, you may also be disappointed by the selection.
Games to try:
Astro’s Playroom: This is a free game that is included on every PS5. It is a charming platformer game that shows off the major features of the PS5 while giving you a bit of history with PlayStation itself.
Demon’s Souls: This is a remake of an older game from the PlayStation 3. It’s a roleplaying game with excellent visuals and difficult, but engaging combat. If you are relatively new to video games, I would recommend caution when purchasing it because the game has a reputation for its difficulty.
Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart: This is a continuation of the Ratchet and Clank series that have been around since the PlayStation 2 era. It is a cartoonish style action/adventure/platforming game with lots of interesting weapons and worlds to explore.

      <h3>Nintendo Switch</h3>
      <p>
        Nintendo has been a huge name in the home video game industry since the 1980s. Ever since then, they have released multiple home consoles, handheld consoles, and other different video-game-related accessories. Their most recent console is known as the Nintendo Switch. Currently, the Nintendo Switch has multiple different versions that operate in different capacities, but they all play the same games.
Features
The biggest selling point for the Nintendo Switch is its identity as a hybrid console. It can be played on any modern television with an HDMI and it is able to disconnect from its dock to be played on the go. The base model Nintendo Switch and the Switch OLED has a portable battery life of approximately 4 to 8 hours depending on the game, while the Switch Lite only has about 3 to 7 hours of battery life.
The controllers on the Nintendo Switch and Switch OLED are modular controllers with multiple different configurations depending on how you play the game. It can be put together as one controller, used when attached to the main screen of the console, or even split apart and used as 2 separate controllers that can be shared with someone else.
Many of the games offered on the Nintendo Switch family are family friendly and make great choices to give to kids of all ages. They have many long-lasting franchises that people have heard of over the years such as Super Mario and Pokémon. They remain as the company with some of the longest lasting and highest grossing game titles of all time.
The Nintendo Switch also has an online membership program that has its own benefits, such as the ability to play Nintendo games online with people and a catalogue of older games from the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo. It is also one of the cheaper membership programs available.
Drawbacks
Overall, the Nintendo Switch doesn’t have the same kind of graphical output that most game consoles possess. The performance of the Switch is a bit lacking, which sometimes results in games slowing down or stuttering.
While Nintendo has an online membership program, some of the features that it uses aren’t well integrated, such as needing friend codes to play with friends and voice chat being regulated as a separate application on your smartphone. 
One of the biggest problems with Nintendo Switch controllers is a phenomenon known as “drift.” Over time as the analog sticks on the controller are used, it may begin to degrade to a point where it detects movement when none is present. You may need to replace the controllers after a year or so.
Games to Play
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate: This is a fighting game that stars many characters from across multiple video game franchises. It has multiple different game modes, multiplayer, and over 80 characters to play.
Super Mario Odyssey: This is a platformer starring Mario, one of the most famous video game characters of all time. It is a fun adventure across multiple different worlds and great controls.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: This is an open world adventure game from the Legend of Zelda franchise. You explore the land of Hyrule defeating monsters and grow stronger in order to save the world from the evil Calamity Ganon.
