    <p>Hello, everyone! I am an accounting student from Paris, Tennessee. Before you ask, yes, we do have an Eiffel Tower. 
        I am the oldest of 3 brothers. I am the first person on either side of my family to serve a full-time mission.
        I served in the Washington, Tacoma Mission from 2014-2016. Name a nerdy pasttime and I've probably tried it or actively do it.
        Currently, I play videogames, Dungeons and Dragons, Yugioh and Magic: The Gathering (although it's been a while since I played MTG).
        Thank you for reading my page and I hope to learn many things for the future! </p>
